## Guidelines

When creating a quick reference:

1. **Focus on commands**: Show the actual commands to run
2. **Include examples**: Real code examples
3. **Keep it brief**: Just the essentials
4. **Link to details**: Reference full docs for more info
5. **One topic per file**: Split large topics
6. **Keep it concise**: Under 400 lines

## When to Add a Quick Reference

Add a quick reference when:
- You find yourself looking up the same commands
- A task is common but not obvious
- New team members ask the same questions
- You want a cheat sheet for a topic
