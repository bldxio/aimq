# 🎯 ACTION: Explore Knowledge Garden Topics

Dive deep into topics from the knowledge garden to understand patterns, standards, and architecture.

See @CONSTITUTION.md for project conventions and @.claude/GARDENING.md for garden structure.

## 📋 STEPS

1. **Identify topic** - Determine what topic to explore from conversation or user input
2. **Search garden** - Look for related content in .claude/ directories
3. **Gather related files** - Find all patterns, standards, architecture docs, and quick references
4. **Read and synthesize** - Review content and understand key concepts
5. **Connect concepts** - Identify relationships between different pieces of knowledge
6. **Present findings** - Show relevant patterns, standards, and guidance
7. **Apply to current work** - Suggest how to use this knowledge in current context
8. **Suggest follow-ups** - Recommend related topics to explore or actions to take

## 💡 CONTEXT

**Search locations:**
- `.claude/patterns/` - Code patterns and design solutions
- `.claude/standards/` - Best practices and conventions
- `.claude/architecture/` - System design and decisions
- `.claude/quick-references/` - How-tos and troubleshooting

**How to explore:**
- Use `rg` to search for keywords across garden
- Follow cross-links between related topics
- Look for examples in actual code
- Connect patterns to current work

**When to use /focus:**
- Before implementing a feature (check for existing patterns)
- When stuck on a problem (look for similar solutions)
- To understand project conventions (review standards)
- To learn system architecture (read architecture docs)

**Present findings clearly:**
- Summarize key points
- Show relevant code examples
- Explain when to apply patterns
- Link to related topics

## 🔗 Follow-up Commands
