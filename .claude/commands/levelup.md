# 🎯 ACTION: Research and Add New Knowledge

Research topics on the web and add valuable insights to the knowledge garden.

See @CONSTITUTION.md for project conventions and @.claude/GARDENING.md for garden structure.

## 📋 STEPS

1. **Identify topic** - Determine what to research from conversation or user input
2. **Search the web** - Use web search to find current information and best practices
3. **Evaluate sources** - Assess quality, relevance, and applicability to project
4. **Synthesize findings** - Summarize key insights and actionable guidance
5. **Determine category** - Decide if pattern, standard, architecture, or quick reference
6. **Draft content** - Create clear documentation with examples and links
7. **Present for approval** - Show what will be added and where
8. **Add to garden** - Create or update files in appropriate directory
9. **Suggest application** - Recommend how to apply new knowledge to current work

## 💡 CONTEXT

**Good topics to research:**
- New libraries or frameworks being considered
- Best practices for technologies in use
- Design patterns for current problems
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security best practices
- Testing strategies

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is it relevant to the project?
- Is it from a reputable source?
- Is it current and up-to-date?
- Can we apply it practically?
- Does it align with project values?

**Content structure:**
- Clear explanation of concept
- Why it matters for this project
- How to apply it (with examples)
- When to use / when not to use
- Links to sources and further reading

**Garden categories:**
- `.claude/patterns/` - New code patterns discovered
- `.claude/standards/` - Best practices to adopt
- `.claude/architecture/` - Design approaches to consider
- `.claude/quick-references/` - How-to guides for new tools

## 🔗 Follow-up Commands
