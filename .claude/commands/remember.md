# 🎯 ACTION: Capture Insights and Patterns

Record patterns, lessons, and insights from the current conversation into the knowledge garden.

See @CONSTITUTION.md for project conventions and @.claude/GARDENING.md for knowledge garden structure.

## 📋 STEPS

1. Identify patterns - Review conversation for recurring solutions, approaches, or decisions
2. Extract insights - Capture key learnings, aha moments, or important realizations
3. Determine category - Decide if pattern, standard, architecture decision, or quick reference
4. Draft content - Create clear, actionable documentation with examples
5. Add cross-links - Link to related content in the knowledge garden
6. Present for approval - Show what will be added and where
7. Add to garden - Create or update files in appropriate directory
8. Suggest constitutional updates - If insight is critical, recommend adding to CONSTITUTION.md
9. Confirm addition - Show what was added and suggest next steps
