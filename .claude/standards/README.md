> 📖 **See [INDEX.md](../INDEX.md) for complete knowledge base navigation**

## Available Standards

### Development Workflow
- **[conventional-commits.md](conventional-commits.md)** - Commit message format and CHANGELOG generation
- **[git-workflow.md](git-workflow.md)** - Git branching and workflow
- **[precommit-workflow.md](precommit-workflow.md)** - Run quality checks before committing

### Code Quality
- **[testing.md](testing.md)** - Testing standards, patterns, and best practices
- **[code-style.md](code-style.md)** - Code formatting, naming conventions, and style guide

### Documentation
- **[command-structure.md](command-structure.md)** - Standard structure for command files

## Guidelines

When documenting a new standard:

1. **Define the standard**: What's the rule or best practice?
2. **Explain the why**: Why do we follow this standard?
3. **Show examples**: Good and bad examples
4. **Provide tools**: Commands, configs, automation
5. **Keep it actionable**: Focus on "how-to"
6. **Keep it concise**: Under 400 lines

## When to Add a Standard

Add a standard when:
- A best practice has been established
- You want to prevent common mistakes
- Consistency is important for the team
- Automation can enforce the standard
