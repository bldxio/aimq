# Knowledge Systems

A structured approach to capturing, organizing, and evolving project knowledge. Think of it as a "second brain" for your project that grows with every lesson learned.

## Overview

This guide is split into focused topics:

- **[Knowledge Systems Overview](./knowledge-systems-overview.md)** - Philosophy, hierarchy, core values, and the dream
- **[Knowledge Systems Templates](./knowledge-systems-templates.md)** - Standard templates for patterns, standards, architecture, quick references
- **[Knowledge Systems Workflow](./knowledge-systems-workflow.md)** - Gardening workflow, best practices, maintenance checklist

## Quick Reference

### The Knowledge Hierarchy
```
CONSTITUTION.md  → Who we are
    ↓
VISION.md        → Where we're going
    ↓
.claude/         → What we know
    ↓
PLAN.md          → What we're doing
```

### Core Values
1. **Living Documentation** - Evolves with the project
2. **Small and Focused** - Files under 400 lines
3. **Linked Knowledge** - Build a knowledge graph
4. **Shallow Structure** - No nested directories
5. **Continuous Cultivation** - Regular maintenance

### Gardening Workflow
1. **Capture (Daily)** - Use `/remember` to capture insights
2. **Learn (Weekly)** - Use `/learn` to extract lessons
3. **Organize (Monthly)** - Use `/cultivate` to maintain
4. **Explore (As Needed)** - Use `/focus` and `/levelup`

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Philosophy
Start with [@.claude/architecture/knowledge-systems-overview.md](./knowledge-systems-overview.md) to learn:
- The problem and solution
- The knowledge hierarchy
- Core values
- The dream

### 2. Learn the Templates
See [@.claude/architecture/knowledge-systems-templates.md](./knowledge-systems-templates.md) for:
- Pattern template
- Standard template
- Architecture template
- Quick reference template
- Command template
- File size guidelines

### 3. Follow the Workflow
Check [@.claude/architecture/knowledge-systems-workflow.md](./knowledge-systems-workflow.md) for:
- Daily capture process
- Weekly learning process
- Monthly organization process
- Best practices
- Maintenance checklist

## Common Use Cases

### Capture an Insight
```bash
/remember "Workers should catch all exceptions in the main loop"
```

### Extract Lessons
```bash
/learn
```

### Maintain the Garden
```bash
/cultivate
```

### Explore a Topic
```bash
/focus "error handling"
```

### Bootstrap a New System
```bash
/seed
```
